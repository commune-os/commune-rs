    Commune Server written in Rust
  </h3>
</div>

Commune allows you to create free, open and public communities on top
of the [Matrix](https://matrix.org) protocol. It allows homeservers to expose
(a subset of) spaces and rooms to the world wide web, extending them with
extra community features, such as discussion boards and threaded comments.

A comprehensive introduction of the concept is offered in the article about [Communal Bonfires](https://blog.erlend.sh/communal-bonfires).

We currenly aim to reimplement [commune-server](commune-server),
which is written in Golang. The goal is to prove that Rust is fit
for backend programming and offers a variety of exclusive benefits over other languages
that encourage good practices while retaining low-level control over details.
